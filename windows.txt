To get python up and running on windows

1. Open python.org in browser & download windows installer
2. Run the installer
3. Open command prompt
4. We'll use this to convert some of these programs to standalone exe's:
      pip install pyinstaller
5. We'll also want to create installers for some of these programs:
      inno ???

Let's test some basic functionality

5. Demos - need data dir also (for cartopy demo)
   Open command prompt,
   cd Python/demos
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat

6. Sound - the last piece of the puzzle
   cd ../sound
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat

Ok, let's get some of the actual apps up & running

7. Libs
   Need to Python/libs to PYTHONPATH.
   Can do this each time:
       set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\Usrs\???\Python\libs
   or, to make it permanent:
       setx PYTHONPATH %PYTHONPATH%;C:\Usrs\???\Python\libs

8. World clock - works great
   cd ../wclock
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat

9. Grid plotter - works great
   cd ../grids
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
10. Band map - works great
   cd ../bandmap
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
11. Call history 
   cd ../history
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat

12. cd ../pyKeyer - So far so good - need to connect keyer ...
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
13. cd ../pySat - Looking good - need to handle initial startup with no .satrc
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
14. RBN analysis - works great
   cd ../rbn_tool
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
15. ADIF manipulations - seems fine
   cd ../adif_tool
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
16a. Rig Control - haven't tested in winblows 11
   cd ../ftdx
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
16b. Rig Control - haven't tested in winblows 11
   cd ../pyRig
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
16c. Rig Control  - haven't tested in winblows 11
   cd ../findRig
   Follow the instructions given in windoz.bat
   
17. cd ../pySDR
    This is very much a work in progress under winblows BUT most of the functionality of this code can be achieved by following the instructions given in windoz.bat
