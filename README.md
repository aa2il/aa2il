### AA2IL Repository

This repository is a collection of codes related to ham radio that I have developed over the years and regularly use in my daily operations.  Feel free to make use any of these for personal non-commercial purposes AT YOUR OWN RISK.  These codes are made available without any implied guarrentees. I only ask that proper attribution be given to the original source.  I welcome any constructive feedback and/or improvements.

More detailed descriptions of each package and the entire suite is in the works.  Related websites include https://aa2il.github.io/ and https://www.qrz.com/db/AA2IL/
